# bash 

liked the way ryanb setup his dotfiles for bash. 
https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles/tree/custom-bash-zsh

bash_profile - looks to load bashrc
bashrc - sources the scripts in bash folder
  bash/aliases
  bash/completions
  bash/paths
  bash/config

i like how the bash config is separated out into logical groups, it simplifies 
reading and understanding.  not to mention you could use it to cherrypick features, 
especially useful in heterogenous environments.  that said, there could be issues if 
ruby/rake not already present on the system.
